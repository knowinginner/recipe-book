## Story: Timmy making Chapati
Once upon a time, there lived a curious little boy named Timmy. He loved spending time with his grandmother, who always seemed to be cooking up something delicious in the kitchen. One day, as the sun shone brightly through the window, Timmy watched as his grandmother skillfully kneaded dough for chapatis, the soft flour clouding the air as she worked.
Timmy was fascinated. He asked, "Grandma, can I try? I want to learn how to make fluffy chapatis like yours!" With a twinkle in her eye, Grandma smiled and replied, "Of course, my dear. The secret to perfect chapatis is all in the kneading."
So, Timmy rolled up his sleeves and washed his hands. His small hands began to mimic his grandmother's movements. He pressed, pushed, and stretched the dough, feeling the soft resistance beneath his palms. "It's like magic!" he exclaimed. Grandma laughed and said, "Indeed, it is. But it's also a lot of hard work and practice."
Days turned into weeks, and Timmy made it a routine to help his grandmother make chapatis. He learned how to roll the dough into perfect circles and cook them just right so they puffed up beautifully. His family would often find him in the kitchen, covered in flour, but always with a big smile on his face.
Years passed, and Timmy grew up. He never forgot the lessons his grandmother had taught him, and his love for cooking remained. As a young man, he decided to open a small restaurant, serving delicious meals to hungry customers. And you'll never guess what his secret weapon was...
That's right! It was his famous, mouth-watering flatbreadsâ€”a recipe inspired by his grandmother's chapatis. People would travel from far and wide just to taste the soft, fluffy bread that seemed to melt in their mouths. Timmy's restaurant became a huge success, all because he had learned the art of kneading dough at a young age.
So, remember, just like Timmy, you too can turn your passions and skills into something extraordinary. And who knows, maybe one day, your own special talents will lead you to success and a pile of flour...or gold!

## Classic Chapati Recipe
Chapatis are delicious and versatile flatbreads that are a staple in Indian cuisine. Here's what you'll need to make them:
## Ingredients:
* 2 cups atta flour (also called chapati flour or whole wheat flour)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/3 cup warm water (plus additional water as needed)
* 1-2 tablespoons vegetable oil
## Instructions:
1. **Make the Dough:** In a large bowl, combine the atta flour and salt. Slowly add the warm water, mixing with your hands until a shaggy dough forms. If the dough feels dry, add a little more water, one tablespoon at a time, until it becomes soft and pliable.
2. **Knead the Dough:** Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 5-7 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic. Add a little more flour if the dough feels sticky.
3. **Rest the Dough:** Form the dough into a ball, place it in a bowl greased with some oil, and cover it with a damp cloth. Let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature.
4. **Divide and Shape:** Divide the dough into 8-10 equal balls. Roll each ball into a smooth circle, about 5-6 inches in diameter, using a rolling pin dusted with flour.
5. **Cook the Chapatis:** Heat a cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. Brush the pan with a thin layer of oil. Once hot, carefully place a chapati on the pan. Cook for about 30-40 seconds per side, or until golden brown spots appear. You may also see the chapati puff up a bit.
6. **Puff the Chapatis (Optional):** Once the chapati has cooked for about 30 seconds on the first side, use a pair of tongs to gently hold it over a direct flame (like a gas stove burner) for a few seconds. This will puff up the chapati further.
7. **Serve:** Brush the cooked chapati with a little melted butter or ghee (clarified butter) for extra flavor. Serve hot with your favorite curries or dals.
## Option:
- You can adjust the amount of water depending on the brand of atta flour you use.
- If you don't have a rolling pin, you can use a flat-bottomed glass or plate to roll out the dough.
- Leftover chapatis can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. Reheat them in a skillet or microwave before serving.
