## Story: Egg spinning
In a sunny farmyard lived a little girl named Maisie. Every morning, her favorite part of breakfast was cracking open a fresh egg, watching the golden yolk plop onto the pan. One day, holding an egg in her hand, she looked at her grandma, stirring the pancake batter. "Grandma," Maisie asked, "how do you know which eggs are the good ones for breakfast?"
Grandma smiled, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "That's a secret, little chef," she said with a wink. Maisie couldn't resist a challenge. Later that day, with a mischievous glint in her eye, she snuck into the coop. Hens clucked around her, pecking at the ground. Maisie knelt beside a basket full of eggs, all smooth and speckled. How would she know which were good?
Remembering Grandma's wink, she picked up an egg and gave it a gentle spin on a flat rock. The egg twirled for a moment, then wobbled slightly before stopping. Maisie frowned. It didn't seem very good. Just then, a wise old rooster named Reginald strutted by.
"Need a hand, little one?" he asked, his voice booming. Maisie jumped, startled. "I, uh, I'm trying to find the good eggs for breakfast," she stammered. Reginald chuckled, his red comb bobbing. "Ah, the spin test! A good one for a curious chick."
He gently took the egg from her. With a flick of his wing, he sent it spinning again, this time much faster. The egg spun and spun, perfectly balanced on its point. It slowed down, wobbled a tiny bit, then righted itself, standing perfectly still.
"See that, Maisie?" Reginald explained. "A fresh egg spins true and stops quickly. When it wobbles much or takes forever to stop, it's getting a bit old."
Maisie's eyes sparkled. She practiced spinning more eggs, giggling as some wobbled like dizzy dancers. Soon, she could tell the fresh ones from the older ones at a glance. When Grandma returned to the coop later, she found Maisie carefully sorting eggs, a proud smile on her face.
"Well, well, little chef," Grandma said, raising an eyebrow. "Looks like you've learned the secret!" From that day on, Maisie became the official egg-spinner, her breakfast-loving heart full of joy and the secret of the perfect spin!

## Recipe for Microwave Scrambled Eggs
## Ingredients:
* 1 large egg per child
* 1 tablespoon milk (or water) per child
* Pinch of salt and pepper (optional)
* Non-stick cooking spray
* Microwave-safe mug (one for each child)
* Fork
* Plastic wrap
## Instructions:
1. **Prep Time (Adult):** Wash any mugs and ensure they are microwave-safe. Spray a light coating of non-stick cooking spray inside each mug.
2. **Crackin' Time (Adult Supervision):** Have each child crack an egg into their own mug. You can help them by gently tapping the egg on a flat surface and then carefully prying it open.
3. **Whisk it Up:** Let each child whisk their egg with a tablespoon of milk (or water) using their fork. Add a pinch of salt and pepper (optional) for older kids.
4. **Cover Up (Adult):** Instruct each child to carefully cover the top of their mug with plastic wrap, making sure there's a small vent for steam to escape by poking a small hole with a fork in the plastic wrap.
5. **Microwave Time (Adult):** Place one mug at a time in the microwave. Microwave on medium power (50% power) for 30 seconds.
6. **The Big Scramble (Adult Carefully Removes Mug):** **Adult carefully removes the mug using a pot holder!** Let the child carefully remove the plastic wrap (beware of hot steam) and stir the eggs with their fork.
7. **Cook in Increments:** Based on the consistency of the eggs, continue microwaving in 15-second intervals on medium power, stirring in between each interval, until the eggs are cooked through (no runny whites) and reach desired consistency.
8. **Serve and Enjoy!** Let the mug cool slightly before each child enjoys their Microwave Scrambled Eggs!
## Safety Tips:
* Adult supervision is crucial throughout this recipe due to using the microwave.
* Only use microwave-safe mugs.
* Instruct children not to touch the hot mug or remove the plastic wrap without adult help.
* Be aware of hot steam when removing the plastic wrap.
* Microwaving eggs can be unpredictable. The cooking time may vary depending on the wattage of your microwave. It's better to err on the side of undercooking and then microwaving in short increments to avoid overcooked eggs.
## Option:
* Add on top of the egg spices such as sweet paprika or cut herbs such as thyme, rosemary, parsley, chives, cilantro, dill, basil, oregano or sage.
* Add on top of the egg small tomatoes, nuts or other ingredients.
* You can use food colorant to make the eggs color you like and observe how does it affect your appetite.
