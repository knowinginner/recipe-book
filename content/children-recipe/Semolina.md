## Story: Maisie and Magical Semolina
Once upon a time, in a land where breakfasts were grand adventures, lived a little girl named Maisie. Maisie had sunshine-yellow hair and a smile that could light up a room, but there was one thing she hated with a fiery passion: semolina.
Every morning, her grandma, Nana Nell, would whip up a bowl of this gloopy, greyish mush that looked like wallpaper paste. "Semolina makes you strong, Maisie!" Nana Nell would boom, her voice as cheerful as a foghorn. But Maisie would wrinkle her nose like a bunny sniffing a skunk.
This particular morning, Nana Nell served the semolina with a flourish. "Today, my dear," she announced, "we have a sprinkle of magical blueberries!" Maisie peered into the bowl. Sure enough, nestled amongst the gloop were a few lonely blueberries, looking like shipwrecked sailors in a sea of sludge.
Maisie sighed dramatically. Just as she was about to declare a hunger strike, Nana Nell leaned in and whispered, "There's a secret, Maisie. With every spoonful, you get to puff out a magic breath that makes the semolina thicker!"
Maisie's eyes widened. Could this be true? She cautiously dipped her spoon and took a small bite. The semolina stuck to her tongue like glue, but remembering Nana Nell's words, she puffed out her cheeks and blew a mighty breath. To her astonishment, the semolina wobbled and jiggled, visibly thickening.
A giggle escaped Maisie's lips. This was fun! She shovelled in another spoonful and blew another puff. The semolina grew thicker, like a slow-motion avalanche. Nana Nell's eyes widened. "Woah there, Maisie! Not too much!" she cried.
But Maisie was on a roll. Spoonful after spoonful, puff after puff, the semolina grew into a magnificent, wobbly mountain. It reached all the way to the ceiling, nearly brushing the chandelier. Nana Nell was sputtering, a mixture of fear and amusement on her face.
Suddenly, with a mighty POP, a blueberry at the peak of the semolina mountain burst! Out popped a tiny, blue-faced genie, spluttering and coughing. "Blimey!" he wheezed. "That was a close call! Almost got swallowed whole!"
Nana Nell and Maisie stared, open-mouthed. The genie puffed out his chest. "I am Barry the Blueberry Genie, and for freeing me, I shall grant you a wish!"
Maisie grinned. "I wish... I wish for this semolina mountain to disappear!"
In a blink, the semolina vanished. Nana Nell blinked. "Well," she chuckled, "that was certainly an eventful breakfast. How about some toast instead?"
Maisie beamed. From that day on, semolina breakfasts were a thing of the past. But whenever Maisie saw a bowl of porridge, she couldn't help but remember the day she turned breakfast into a hilarious, wobbly adventure, all thanks to a magical puff of breath.

## Sunshine Semolina Pudding 
This recipe is a fun twist on classic semolina pudding, perfect for a bright and cheerful breakfast!
## Ingredients:
- 2 cups milk
- 1/4 cup semolina flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- Pinch of salt
- 1/4 cup fresh blueberries
- 1 tablespoon honey (optional)
## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, whisk together the milk, sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Heat over medium heat until the milk begins to simmer (tiny bubbles around the edges).
2. Slowly whisk in the semolina flour, making sure there are no lumps. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. The pudding will thicken up nicely.
3. Remove the pan from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.
4. Divide the pudding between two bowls. Top each bowl with fresh blueberries.
5. Drizzle with honey for an extra touch of sweetness (optional).
## Tips:
- For a richer flavor, substitute 1 tablespoon of heavy cream for 1 tablespoon of milk.
- Add a pinch of nutmeg alongside the cinnamon for a warm, spiced flavor.
- If your blueberries are frozen, don't thaw them beforehand. Just add them frozen to the hot pudding and they will soften up perfectly.
- This pudding can be served warm or chilled. If you prefer it chilled, simply let it cool completely at room temperature before transferring it to the refrigerator. It will keep for up to 3 days.
## Option:
- Use any other fruit
- Add butter on top
