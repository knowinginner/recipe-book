## Story: DIY cheese
Once upon a time, in a cozy cottage nestled among rolling hills, lived a curious little girl named Lily. Lily loved cheese in all its glorious forms, from creamy ricotta to bouncy mozzarella. One sunny afternoon, after devouring a particularly delicious grilled cheese sandwich, a question popped into her head like a fluffy cloud.
"Mommy," Lily asked, her mouth still full of melted cheese, "how do they make cheese? Do they milk the clouds?"
Mommy chuckled, wiping a cheesy grin from Lily's cheek. "Not quite, sweetie! Cheese actually comes from milk, just like the milk you drink for breakfast."
Lily's eyes widened. "But milk is all white and slurpy! How does it turn into yummy yellow cheese?"
Determined to unlock this cheesy mystery, Lily grabbed a mixing bowl decorated with playful kittens chasing butterflies. With a mischievous grin, she raced to the kitchen, eager to make cheese of her own.
"Let's make cheese, Mommy!" she declared, dragging a stool to reach the counter.
Mommy smiled at her daughter's enthusiasm. "Making cheese takes a little more than just milk, Lily. We need some special helpers."
Together, they gathered the ingredients: a carton of fresh milk, a jug of lemon juice (not quite the same as milking a cloud, Lily thought with a giggle), and a pot for heating.
Following Mommy's instructions, Lily carefully poured the milk into the pot. Then, with a big squeeze (and a funny face!), she added a little bit of lemon juice.
"Now what, Mommy?" Lily asked, her eyes sparkling with anticipation.
Mommy placed the pot on the stove over low heat. "We need to gently warm the milk," she explained, stirring it slowly with a spoon. "The lemon juice acts like a magic spell, causing the milk to separate into curds and whey."
Lily watched in fascination as the milk started to change. Tiny white clumps began to form, floating amidst the clear liquid.
"Wow! It's working!" Lily exclaimed, bouncing on the balls of her feet.
Once the curds formed, Mommy carefully strained the mixture through a cheesecloth, a white fabric that looked like a spiderweb to Lily. The whey, the leftover liquid, went into a bowl for later (it's perfect for making pancakes, Mommy explained!).
In the cheesecloth remained a soft, white mass – the magic cheese curds! Lily reached out to touch them, surprised by their soft and bouncy texture.
"We can add some salt and herbs to these curds to make them even tastier," Mommy said, adding a sprinkle of each.
Lily helped mix the ingredients gently. Soon, in their bowl, sat a fluffy, white cheese spread, like a cloud that tasted good!
Mommy spread the cheese on crackers, and Lily took a bite. Her eyes widened with delight. "It's delicious, Mommy! We made real cheese!"
Lily learned that day that cheese making wasn't as simple as milking a cloud, but it was certainly a fun and rewarding adventure, especially with a helping hand (and a little sprinkle of science magic!) from her mommy. As they enjoyed their yummy creation, Lily dreamed of becoming a cheese whiz someday, creating all sorts of delicious cheeses for everyone to enjoy.

## Make Your Own Mini Mozzarella!
This recipe is a fun way to explore how cheese is made, but it's important to have an adult help you in the kitchen! Hot milk and sharp objects like knives can be dangerous.
Here's what you'll need:
## Ingredients:
* 1 cup whole milk (make sure it's pasteurized!)
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice (freshly squeezed is best!)
* Pinch of salt (optional)
* Cheesecloth (or a clean thin dishtowel)
* Bowl
* Strainer or colander
* Spoon
* Large pot
* Spoon (wooden or silicone)
* Adult helper!
## Instruction Let's Get Cheesy!
1. **Milk Mission:**
* Ask your grown-up to help you heat the milk in the pot over medium heat. Don't let it boil! Just watch for tiny bubbles around the edges. You can as well put the milk inside the glass and heat it in the microwave stoping the timer just before the milk overflow the border. (It takes strong nerves and fast reaction).
2. **Lemon Zest:**
* While the milk heats, your grown-up can squeeze the lemon juice. You can smell the lemony scent – that's what makes the milk curdle (separate into curds and whey)!
3. **Curd Crazy!**
* Once the milk is hot, carefully turn off the heat. With your grown-up helping, slowly stir in the lemon juice. Watch closely! The milk will start to clump and separate into white curds (the cheese part) and yellowish liquid (the whey). It's like magic!
4. **Cheesecloth Catch:**
* Place the strainer or colander over a bowl. Line the strainer with cheesecloth (or your clean dishtowel). Carefully pour the curds and whey mixture into the lined strainer.
5. **Whey Away!**
* Let the curds sit for a few minutes to drain the whey. You can gently squeeze the cheesecloth to remove even more liquid. Be careful, it might be hot!
6. **Salty Surprise!** (Optional)
* If you want your cheese to have a little more flavor, ask your grown-up to sprinkle a tiny pinch of salt over the curds in the cheesecloth.
7. **Shaping Up!**
* Now comes the fun part! Carefully gather the cheesecloth around the curds, forming them into a small ball. You can even twist the cheesecloth to squeeze out even more whey.
8. **Chill Out!**
* Place your mini cheese ball in a small bowl and put it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. This lets the cheese firm up.
9. **Mozzarella Magic!**
* Once chilled, take out your cheese ball and unwrap it from the cheesecloth. Congratulations! You've just made your own mini mozzarella cheese!
**Time to Eat!**
You can enjoy your mini mozzarella cheese plain, or try these fun ideas:
* Slice it up and add it to a salad.
* Top a cracker with your cheese and a sprinkle of your favorite herbs.
* Drizzle it with a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar for a grown-up taste.
Remember, this cheese is best eaten fresh within a day or two.
## Option:
* You can add to milk herbs, raising, olives, sesame or other seed to add flavor
* You can add food colorant to make your cheese the color you like.
This is a simple recipe to get you started on your cheese making journey. There are many other types of cheese you can explore with an adult's help!

## Story Secret ingredient to the strongest superheroes
Lily, a six-year-old with hair as fiery as a chili pepper, was not a fan of vegetables. Every dinner was a battlefield – broccoli became tiny trees that threatened to topple over her plate, and carrots were orange intruders disguised as candy. Her parents were at their wit's end.
One sunny afternoon, Lily's grandpa, a man with a twinkle in his eye and a garden overflowing with surprises, decided to take matters into his own hands. He presented Lily with a tiny jar filled with round, beige pebbles.
"What are these, Grandpa?" Lily asked, poking them suspiciously.
"These, my dear," he boomed, "are magic growth stones! Plant them in this wet paper towel," he said, handing her a damp piece, "and watch them transform into the most magnificent creatures you've ever seen!"
Lily's eyes widened. Magic? Creatures? This was far more exciting than boring vegetables. Carefully, she placed the "magic stones" on the paper towel and Grandpa helped her fold it into a cozy bed.
Every day, Lily meticulously watered her "creatures," whispering to them and making sure they got enough sunshine. Days turned into weeks, and Lily's patience was wearing thin. Where were these magnificent creatures? All she had was a damp, smelly paper towel.
One morning, Lily burst into the kitchen, dragging the jar behind her. "Grandpa, your magic growth stones are sick!" she declared, pointing at tiny green shoots poking out.
Grandpa chuckled. "Those aren't sick, Lily! Those are baby bean sprouts, getting ready to become big and strong!"
Disappointment clouded Lily's face. Bean sprouts? Were those the magnificent creatures she'd been waiting for? Grandpa, sensing her dejection, had an idea. "You know what? Bean sprouts are the secret ingredient to the strongest superheroes! Wanna try some?"
Lily's eyes lit up. Superheroes! She picked up a sprout with a newfound respect. It might not be a dragon, but maybe, just maybe, it was the key to super strength.
That night, Lily devoured a salad topped with her "superhero sprouts," crunching happily. Maybe vegetables weren't so bad after all, especially if they held the power of super strength! From then on, Lily continued to sprout different beans, each one a new adventure and a secret ingredient to her superhero training. The battles at the dinner table stopped, replaced by a little girl who discovered that vegetables, though not magical, could be pretty darn amazing after all.

## Sprouting Fun: Growing a Mini-Meal with the Kids
Have you ever wondered how the crunchy bean sprouts in your favorite stir-fry or salad get their start? Well, the answer might surprise you! Sprouts are actually the very young seedlings of various beans, seeds, and grains, and growing them is a fun and educational activity that kids of all ages can enjoy.
In this article, we'll be focusing on the mighty soybean sprout! Packed with protein and vitamins, soybean sprouts are a delicious and nutritious addition to any meal. Let's get those little hands dirty and cultivate a healthy snack together!
## Planting the Seeds of Fun
Here's what you'll need:
* A shallow container (jar, bowl, or tray with drainage holes)
* Dry soybeans (organic is preferred)
* Water
* Cheesecloth or a thin dishtowel
**Step 1: Bean Selection**
Head to your local grocery store and pick up a bag of dry soybeans. Avoid pre-packaged or flavored beans, as they may have coatings that inhibit sprouting.
**Step 2: Soaking the Beans**
Rinse the soybeans thoroughly in a colander. In your chosen container, add the soybeans and enough water to cover them by about an inch. Let them soak for 8-12 hours, or overnight. The beans will plump up considerably during this time.
**Step 3: The Sprouting Symphony**
After soaking, drain the water and rinse the beans again. Place the container at an angle to allow for drainage. Here's the fun part! Cover the container with cheesecloth or a dishtowel, securing it with a rubber band. This keeps the beans moist but allows for air circulation.
**Step 4: Sprout Watch!**
Rinse the beans twice a day with fresh water, draining thoroughly each time. This ensures proper moisture and prevents mold growth. Within a few days, you'll start to see tiny white roots and green shoots emerge from the beans. This is the magic of germination!
**Step 5: Harvest Time!**
In about 3-5 days, your soybean sprouts will be ready to enjoy! They should be around 1-2 inches long with firm roots and bright green shoots. Rinse them one last time and arrange them on a plate.
## The Sprouty Feast!
Now comes the rewarding part – enjoying the fruits (or rather, sprouts!) of your labor. Soybean sprouts can be eaten raw in salads, stir-fried with vegetables, or added to sandwiches for a delightful crunch. You can even experiment with different toppings like a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of your favorite herbs.
## Sprouting: More Than Just a Meal
Growing soybean sprouts with your children is a fantastic way to:
* **Teach them about plant growth and the importance of healthy eating.**
* **Encourage responsibility and patience.** Caring for the sprouts twice a day instills a sense of ownership.
* **Bond over a fun and educational activity.**
* **Celebrate the joy of cultivating your own food!**
So, the next time you're looking for a fun and engaging activity with your kids, consider sprouting some soybean seeds! It's a rewarding experience that will leave them with a newfound appreciation for healthy, homegrown food.

## Story: Egg spinning
In a sunny farmyard lived a little girl named Maisie. Every morning, her favorite part of breakfast was cracking open a fresh egg, watching the golden yolk plop onto the pan. One day, holding an egg in her hand, she looked at her grandma, stirring the pancake batter. "Grandma," Maisie asked, "how do you know which eggs are the good ones for breakfast?"
Grandma smiled, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "That's a secret, little chef," she said with a wink. Maisie couldn't resist a challenge. Later that day, with a mischievous glint in her eye, she snuck into the coop. Hens clucked around her, pecking at the ground. Maisie knelt beside a basket full of eggs, all smooth and speckled. How would she know which were good?
Remembering Grandma's wink, she picked up an egg and gave it a gentle spin on a flat rock. The egg twirled for a moment, then wobbled slightly before stopping. Maisie frowned. It didn't seem very good. Just then, a wise old rooster named Reginald strutted by.
"Need a hand, little one?" he asked, his voice booming. Maisie jumped, startled. "I, uh, I'm trying to find the good eggs for breakfast," she stammered. Reginald chuckled, his red comb bobbing. "Ah, the spin test! A good one for a curious chick."
He gently took the egg from her. With a flick of his wing, he sent it spinning again, this time much faster. The egg spun and spun, perfectly balanced on its point. It slowed down, wobbled a tiny bit, then righted itself, standing perfectly still.
"See that, Maisie?" Reginald explained. "A fresh egg spins true and stops quickly. When it wobbles much or takes forever to stop, it's getting a bit old."
Maisie's eyes sparkled. She practiced spinning more eggs, giggling as some wobbled like dizzy dancers. Soon, she could tell the fresh ones from the older ones at a glance. When Grandma returned to the coop later, she found Maisie carefully sorting eggs, a proud smile on her face.
"Well, well, little chef," Grandma said, raising an eyebrow. "Looks like you've learned the secret!" From that day on, Maisie became the official egg-spinner, her breakfast-loving heart full of joy and the secret of the perfect spin!

## Recipe for Microwave Scrambled Eggs
## Ingredients:
* 1 large egg per child
* 1 tablespoon milk (or water) per child
* Pinch of salt and pepper (optional)
* Non-stick cooking spray
* Microwave-safe mug (one for each child)
* Fork
* Plastic wrap
## Instructions:
1. **Prep Time (Adult):** Wash any mugs and ensure they are microwave-safe. Spray a light coating of non-stick cooking spray inside each mug.
2. **Crackin' Time (Adult Supervision):** Have each child crack an egg into their own mug. You can help them by gently tapping the egg on a flat surface and then carefully prying it open.
3. **Whisk it Up:** Let each child whisk their egg with a tablespoon of milk (or water) using their fork. Add a pinch of salt and pepper (optional) for older kids.
4. **Cover Up (Adult):** Instruct each child to carefully cover the top of their mug with plastic wrap, making sure there's a small vent for steam to escape by poking a small hole with a fork in the plastic wrap.
5. **Microwave Time (Adult):** Place one mug at a time in the microwave. Microwave on medium power (50% power) for 30 seconds.
6. **The Big Scramble (Adult Carefully Removes Mug):** **Adult carefully removes the mug using a pot holder!** Let the child carefully remove the plastic wrap (beware of hot steam) and stir the eggs with their fork.
7. **Cook in Increments:** Based on the consistency of the eggs, continue microwaving in 15-second intervals on medium power, stirring in between each interval, until the eggs are cooked through (no runny whites) and reach desired consistency.
8. **Serve and Enjoy!** Let the mug cool slightly before each child enjoys their Microwave Scrambled Eggs!
## Safety Tips:
* Adult supervision is crucial throughout this recipe due to using the microwave.
* Only use microwave-safe mugs.
* Instruct children not to touch the hot mug or remove the plastic wrap without adult help.
* Be aware of hot steam when removing the plastic wrap.
* Microwaving eggs can be unpredictable. The cooking time may vary depending on the wattage of your microwave. It's better to err on the side of undercooking and then microwaving in short increments to avoid overcooked eggs.
## Option:
* Add on top of the egg spices such as sweet paprika or cut herbs such as thyme, rosemary, parsley, chives, cilantro, dill, basil, oregano or sage.
* Add on top of the egg small tomatoes, nuts or other ingredients.
* You can use food colorant to make the eggs color you like and observe how does it affect your apetite.
