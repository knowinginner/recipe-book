## Story: DIY cheese
Once upon a time, in a cozy cottage nestled among rolling hills, lived a curious little girl named Lily. Lily loved cheese in all its glorious forms, from creamy ricotta to bouncy mozzarella. One sunny afternoon, after devouring a particularly delicious grilled cheese sandwich, a question popped into her head like a fluffy cloud.
"Mommy," Lily asked, her mouth still full of melted cheese, "how do they make cheese? Do they milk the clouds?"
Mommy chuckled, wiping a cheesy grin from Lily's cheek. "Not quite, sweetie! Cheese actually comes from milk, just like the milk you drink for breakfast."
Lily's eyes widened. "But milk is all white and slurpy! How does it turn into yummy yellow cheese?"
Determined to unlock this cheesy mystery, Lily grabbed a mixing bowl decorated with playful kittens chasing butterflies. With a mischievous grin, she raced to the kitchen, eager to make cheese of her own.
"Let's make cheese, Mommy!" she declared, dragging a stool to reach the counter.
Mommy smiled at her daughter's enthusiasm. "Making cheese takes a little more than just milk, Lily. We need some special helpers."
Together, they gathered the ingredients: a carton of fresh milk, a jug of lemon juice (not quite the same as milking a cloud, Lily thought with a giggle), and a pot for heating.
Following Mommy's instructions, Lily carefully poured the milk into the pot. Then, with a big squeeze (and a funny face!), she added a little bit of lemon juice.
"Now what, Mommy?" Lily asked, her eyes sparkling with anticipation.
Mommy placed the pot on the stove over low heat. "We need to gently warm the milk," she explained, stirring it slowly with a spoon. "The lemon juice acts like a magic spell, causing the milk to separate into curds and whey."
Lily watched in fascination as the milk started to change. Tiny white clumps began to form, floating amidst the clear liquid.
"Wow! It's working!" Lily exclaimed, bouncing on the balls of her feet.
Once the curds formed, Mommy carefully strained the mixture through a cheesecloth, a white fabric that looked like a spiderweb to Lily. The whey, the leftover liquid, went into a bowl for later (it's perfect for making pancakes, Mommy explained!).
In the cheesecloth remained a soft, white mass – the magic cheese curds! Lily reached out to touch them, surprised by their soft and bouncy texture.
"We can add some salt and herbs to these curds to make them even tastier," Mommy said, adding a sprinkle of each.
Lily helped mix the ingredients gently. Soon, in their bowl, sat a fluffy, white cheese spread, like a cloud that tasted good!
Mommy spread the cheese on crackers, and Lily took a bite. Her eyes widened with delight. "It's delicious, Mommy! We made real cheese!"
Lily learned that day that cheese making wasn't as simple as milking a cloud, but it was certainly a fun and rewarding adventure, especially with a helping hand (and a little sprinkle of science magic!) from her mommy. As they enjoyed their yummy creation, Lily dreamed of becoming a cheese whiz someday, creating all sorts of delicious cheeses for everyone to enjoy.

## Make Your Own Mini Mozzarella!
This recipe is a fun way to explore how cheese is made, but it's important to have an adult help you in the kitchen! Hot milk and sharp objects like knives can be dangerous.
Here's what you'll need:
## Ingredients:
* 1 cup whole milk (make sure it's pasteurized!)
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice (freshly squeezed is best!)
* Pinch of salt (optional)
* Cheesecloth (or a clean thin dishtowel)
* Bowl
* Strainer or colander
* Spoon
* Large pot
* Spoon (wooden or silicone)
* Adult helper!
## Instruction Let's Get Cheesy!
1. **Milk Mission:**
* Ask your grown-up to help you heat the milk in the pot over medium heat. Don't let it boil! Just watch for tiny bubbles around the edges. You can as well put the milk inside the glass and heat it in the microwave stoping the timer just before the milk overflow the border. (It takes strong nerves and fast reaction).
2. **Lemon Zest:**
* While the milk heats, your grown-up can squeeze the lemon juice. You can smell the lemony scent – that's what makes the milk curdle (separate into curds and whey)!
3. **Curd Crazy!**
* Once the milk is hot, carefully turn off the heat. With your grown-up helping, slowly stir in the lemon juice. Watch closely! The milk will start to clump and separate into white curds (the cheese part) and yellowish liquid (the whey). It's like magic!
4. **Cheesecloth Catch:**
* Place the strainer or colander over a bowl. Line the strainer with cheesecloth (or your clean dishtowel). Carefully pour the curds and whey mixture into the lined strainer.
5. **Whey Away!**
* Let the curds sit for a few minutes to drain the whey. You can gently squeeze the cheesecloth to remove even more liquid. Be careful, it might be hot!
6. **Salty Surprise!** (Optional)
* If you want your cheese to have a little more flavor, ask your grown-up to sprinkle a tiny pinch of salt over the curds in the cheesecloth.
7. **Shaping Up!**
* Now comes the fun part! Carefully gather the cheesecloth around the curds, forming them into a small ball. You can even twist the cheesecloth to squeeze out even more whey.
8. **Chill Out!**
* Place your mini cheese ball in a small bowl and put it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. This lets the cheese firm up.
9. **Mozzarella Magic!**
* Once chilled, take out your cheese ball and unwrap it from the cheesecloth. Congratulations! You've just made your own mini mozzarella cheese!
**Time to Eat!**
You can enjoy your mini mozzarella cheese plain, or try these fun ideas:
* Slice it up and add it to a salad.
* Top a cracker with your cheese and a sprinkle of your favorite herbs.
* Drizzle it with a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar for a grown-up taste.
Remember, this cheese is best eaten fresh within a day or two.
## Option:
* You can add to milk herbs, raising, olives, sesame or other seed to add flavor
* You can add food colorant to make your cheese the color you like.
This is a simple recipe to get you started on your cheese making journey. There are many other types of cheese you can explore with an adult's help!
