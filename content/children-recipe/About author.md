I was born in time when cooking everyday home meal was given in my family. I learned to cook from my grandmother Anna (school cook), my grandmother Elisabeth and my mom and dad from early age. Every one of them possessed slightly different skill set which allow them to create from seemingly similar ingredients marvelous dishes.
My journey continue through living in Germany and learning style of cooking.
Later on living in different provinces in Spain and making paellas, arroz negro, mariscada, etc. 
I was able to cook up to 40 people in Center of Zen Buddhism.
Meeting Takashi Japanese student I learned sushi.
Living in Italy I was exposed to different style of pizzas and ice creams.
Currently I am living in United Kingdom and know how to cook when situation requires.
